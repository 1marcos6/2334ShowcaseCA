Public display of Cellular Automata project. This project was done in the final months of the Spring 2020 semester - at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this project demonstrates my learned proficiency with object oriented programming and concepts within it such as polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. I was also able to become very familiar with the mathematical concept of cellular automata; a concept that at first seems daunting but slowly became more understandable.


In the GitHub repo provided below, I specifically wrote a “Driver” class where I created a cellular automaton that corresponds to “rule” 22. I then evolved this automaton 25 steps, or 25 lines, into the future. Rule 22 of cellular automata produces a very interesting shape, and the more evolutions, the more interesting the patterns are. Here is the machine after 25 evolutions: 

 

The periods represent 0, or off – while the 0 represents 1, or on. 

The old.MD file that accompanies this project is very descriptive as to how the entire project functions – but please note that I created every single function of this project from scratch – except for the README file, InvalidStepNumException.java, and InvalidRuleNumException.java files. These three files were provided to all students.
